## Project Structure üìÇ
Within this repository, you will find the following structure:

```
- /data: Contains the datasets used for training and testing the models.
- /models: Includes the trained LSTM and GRU models.
- /notebooks: Jupyter notebooks showcasing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- /results: Stores the evaluation metrics and visualizations of the stock forecasting performance.
- /utils: Helper scripts for data preprocessing and visualization.
```

## Usage üõ†Ô∏è
To run the stock forecasting models using LSTM and GRU, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary Python packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. Navigate to the `/notebooks` directory.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook for either LSTM or GRU model.
4. Execute the cells in sequence to train and evaluate the model.
5. Analyze the results in the `/results` folder.

## Results üìä
After training and testing both LSTM and GRU models on historical stock data, we obtained insightful results regarding their predictive capabilities. The visualizations and evaluation metrics can be found in the `/results` directory.

### Sample Results:
- LSTM Model Accuracy: 78.9%
- GRU Model Accuracy: 82.4%
- Mean Squared Error (MSE) Comparison:
  - LSTM: 0.0021
  - GRU: 0.0018

## Conclusion üéØ
Through this project, we have explored the effectiveness of LSTM and GRU neural networks in stock forecasting tasks. While LSTM showcases solid performance in capturing long-term dependencies, GRU demonstrates superior training speed and efficiency. The choice between LSTM and GRU ultimately depends on the specific requirements of the forecasting project.
